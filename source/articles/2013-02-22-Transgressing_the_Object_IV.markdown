<blockquote>Engaged pedagogy does not seek simply to empower students. Any classroom that employs a holistic model of learning will also be a place where teachers grow, and are empowered by the process.

-bell hooks, Teaching to Transgress, p. 21</blockquote>
<blockquote>Critical Pedagogy is defined as: "an educational movement, guided by passion and principle, to help students develop <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_consciousness" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_consciousness">consciousness</a> of freedom, recognize authoritarian tendencies, and connect knowledge to power and the ability to take constructive action."

-Giroux, H. (October 27, 2010) "Lessons From Paulo Freire", <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicle_of_Higher_Education" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicle_of_Higher_Education">Chronicle of Higher Education</a>.</blockquote>
In previous articles we have explored some of the problems inherent in education in general and “Deaf Education” in particular. Here, we take the opportunity to share space with students, to listen to some of their thoughts about education. We also offer some thoughts about opportunities created through the use of critical pedagogy.

How about a space without borders that feels welcoming
Designed by the students who here gather to learn

How about circles and ovals instead of rectangles and rows
How about egalitarian and organic instead of dictating and dominating

How about we let the students talk
Share their stories while we listen

How about we stop talking at and start working with
And dig out the truth and strive for the light

How about we don’t be afraid of students
Discovering their power and challenging us to grow

How about we share responsibility for education
And stop blaming delays on “deaf”

And while we’re at it how about we start expecting
full language access
In the learning environment, everywhere (including at home)

Change missions and policies so that we focus on the language of critical pedagogy instead of communication methodologies and hearing levels and keeping those deaf kids safe

And how about we have more deaf teachers deaf administrators
And how about we have more of them be teachers and administrators of color
And Queer too

How about we start challenging our students to be anti-racist anti-sexist anti-audist anti-classist anti-heterosexist and how about we start unpacking our own privileges too

How about we start asking students what they want and need
How about we start trusting that they know
