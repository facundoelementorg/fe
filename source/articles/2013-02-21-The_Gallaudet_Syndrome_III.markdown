## THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT SERIES:
### The Gallaudet Syndrome: Hearing Privileges
A Thesis by Tiffany Tuccoli (G ‘08)
Presented by Alison L. Aubrecht (‘01, G ‘03) and Ryan Commerson (‘01, G ‘08)
December 6, 2010

A recent http://www.thebuffandblue.net/?p=4083 in the Buff and Blue by Elena Ruiz, a graduate student at Gallaudet University, has resulted in the initiation of powerful campus-wide conversations on deeply entrenched institutional audism, language rights, and privileges.

Comments responding to Ruiz’s article show that she has elicited a wide range of reactions, the majority of them expressing resistance and discomfort with the dynamics that her article explores.

Many of the comments leave room for exploring the idea of "hearing privilege." Few people have written about privileges that hearing people have, and one such individual is Tiffany Tuccoli, who wrote about this particular topic while she was a graduate student in the Department of Deaf Studies at Gallaudet.

With permission, we are posting her Masters thesis, which was completed in 2008. http://www.facundoelement.com/media/Hearing_Privilege.pdf
